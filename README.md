# hello-world
A simple Hello World project to learn the basics of GitHub

My name is Ivan, I have a physics degree, and I'm trying to get myself set up as a programmer. I've got a year's worth of experience as a full-stack developer, and as such have experience working with C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL Databases. Hopefully I'll soon fill this account with all kinds of coding goodies!
